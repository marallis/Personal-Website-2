      <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
      <p>My name is Marcus Rallis. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree of Global Business and Digital Arts at the University of Waterloo. I immerse myself in all things creative. I enjoy the feeling I get when creative energy flows through my body. I feel as though creative energy is like water. Everyone has it, yet some may have to dig deeper than others. For me, I have always remembered having a small puddle, and when I do something creative like take a visual arts course in highschool, my creative energy turns into a small stream. When I don't exercise these skills however, that energy begins to dry up. As I was introduced to film this year in my Digital Projects class, I found a medium that really hooked me. Film truly inspired me. I can connect with my viewers emotions and give them a particular feeling. Film is real life but better.</p>

      <p>As I slowly fall deeper into this consciousness, I desire more creative energy. I feel a longing to explore more mediums and expand my stream into a river, then lake, than ocean. Like the ocean, eventually I will have an unnoticed influence on the world.</p>

      <p>I am begining to realize that the only person to ever read this will probably be my TA, so that might have got too deep.</p>

      <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
      <p>Visual arts holds a special place in my heart. It's where my identity as an artist was born. Growing up, my mom would often suggest arts and crafts as an activity when I wasn't playing sports. She is a talented visual artist and nurtured my creative side. I wasn't very confident in my ability with a pencil or paintbrush, maybe because I was constantly comparing myself to her or other kids in my class, but she persistently told me how good I was. In the summer of 2017 it was time to select my electives for grade 9. This was a pivotal educational decision, as I had the freedom to choose electives. All of my friends chose drama because it was the bird course. My parents reminded me that the decisions I made in highschool were important because university was right around the corner. I ultimately chose visual arts. Luckly, with a great teacher and beautiful studio, it has been one of the best classes I've taken to this day. </p>

      <p>Here is some of the work I produced in my visual arts classes in high school.</p>

      <h2>Digital Arts</h2>
      <p>As I sat in Ms. Aylesworth's visual arts class, I noticed another teacher bringing groups of kids into a room at the front of the class. I asked Ms. Aylesworth and she informed me it was Mr. Kr with tech so I imagined this could be my thing. The problem was, my schedule was tight and I couldn't fit all of my academics with visuaawczyk's digital art's class usin386he dark room. I knew I had to try it. I always had an aptitudel and digital arts. I ultimately decided to switch back and forth. Grade 9 I would take visual, grade 10 I would take digital etc. </p>

      <p>Here is some of the work I produced in my digital arts classes in high scool.</p>
